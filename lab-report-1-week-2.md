## **Remotely Connecting**
After installing the OpenSSH program and finding your [course account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) for the course, open VSCode and click Terminal, then New Terminal from the top menu bar. This will open up a powershell terminal at the bottom of the screen. 
<br /> <br />
In the terminal, type `ssh cs15lwi22ars@ieng6.ucsd.edu` to begin the connection to the ucsd server (Make sure to replace the last three letters before the @ with your course-specific account letters).
<br /> <br />
The terminal will then prompt you for the password for your account. When entering your password, you may notice that nothing appears after `Password:` as you type. THIS IS NORMAL! Once the password is typed in, press enter and you should be logged into the ssh and connected to the server.
<br /> <br />
Your terminal should look like this: <br /> <br />
